# lightspeed-BYO-knowledge-test

This repo contains an example of a realistic OpenShift Policy document build from Kyverno documentation (policy as code).

It also contains a series of questions that could be ask to OpenShift Lightspeed, the OpenShift virtual assistant, once LightSpeed ingested the policy document.
