This repo contains an example of a realistic OpenShift Policy document build from ACS (StackRox) and Kyverno. Both those policy as code framework provide some out of the box policy suitable for this document.

It also contains a series of questions that could be ask to OpenShift Lightspeed, the OpenShift virtual assistant, once LightSpeed ingested the policy document.
